Thank you for visiting my portfolio.\n\nI am a front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js. \n\nI have a diverse educational background, including a degree in art and design education and formal training in front-end development. This blend of creativity and technical skills enables me to develop user-centered applications with a strong focus on both functionality and aesthetics.\n\nI am always eager to learn and grow, whether by exploring backend technologies like SQL and NoSQL, improving performance optimization, or experimenting with new frameworks and tools. My goal is to build scalable, maintainable, and efficient web applications that provide great experiences for users.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy exploring creative coding, UI/UX design, and prototyping, as well as spending time outdoors, crocheting amigurumis, and I love to cook.\n","keywords":"Keywords about me","noroff":"Vocational school education in front-end development at Noroff","occupation":"Web development","oslomet":"Bachelors degree in Art, Design and Crafts Teacher at OsloMet","other":"Other","profession":"Web developer, UX-designer","project":{"artfulBids":{"description":"This project was to create an auction website, where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
