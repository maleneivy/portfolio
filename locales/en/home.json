Thank you for visiting my site.\n\nLet me tell you a little about myself. I am from a small village at the coast of Finnmark and I have been living in Oslo for over 10 years.  I decided to change my path during covid and started at Noroff, studying online frontend-development part-time. The last year I have taken the course full time and graduated in June 2024.\n\nWhen I am not coding, I love to camp, fish, crochet amigurumis, run and spend a lot of time with my dog, my fianc√© and my friends.","keywords":"Keywords about me","noroff":"Vocational school education in front-end development at Noroff","occupation":"Junior front-end developer","oslomet":"Bachelors degree in Art, Design and Crafts Teacher at OsloMet","other":"Other","project-info-artful":"This project was to create an auction website, where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
