    intro: `Hi there! Thank you for visiting my site.
    Let me tell you a little about myself. I am from a small village at the coast of Finnmark and I have been living in Oslo for over 10 years. I decided to change my path during covid and started at Noroff, studying frontend-development part-time with online classes. The last year I have taken the course full time and graduated in June 2024.\n
    When I am not coding, I love to camp, fish, crochet amigurumis, run and spend a lot of time with my dog, my fianc√© and my friends.`,
