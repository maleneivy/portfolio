# Portfolio

![Screenshot of the website in mobile view](/public/readme.png)

This is my portfolio which introduces me and the last three projects I've worked on as a Noroff frontend-development student.

This project is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and deployed using Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8c5b80a6-0d26-4d01-a80d-654c03e5744f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/maleneivy/deploys)
